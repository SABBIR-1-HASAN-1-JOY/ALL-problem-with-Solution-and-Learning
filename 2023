//Problem:In a sequence 𝑎, whose product was equal to 2023, 𝑘 numbers were removed, leaving a sequence 𝑏 of length 𝑛.
Given the resulting sequence 𝑏, find any suitable sequence 𝑎 and output which 𝑘 elements were removed from it, or state that such a sequence could not have existed.

Algorithm:
1.As A was a sequence whose product is 2023 . This means 2023 was divisible by product(a[i]) and also by a[i]
2.If we remove some element from A , product(b) will still divide 2023 with 0 remainder
3.So if 2023%product(b[i]) !=0 then there exists no such sequence
  else there exists a sequence and one element is 2023/product(b[i]) and other k-1 elements are 1

CODE:
int n,k,prod=1,ans;
    cin>>n>>k;
    int a[n];

 for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
  cin>>a[i];
  prod*=a[i];
 }
   if(2023%prod){
   cout<<"NO\n";
   } 
   else{
    ans=2023/prod;
    cout<<"YES\n"<<ans;
   for(int i=1;i<k;i++) cout<<" 1";
   cout<<"\n";
   }
