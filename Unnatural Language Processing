//Problem:
Lura was bored and decided to make a simple language using the five letters 𝚊, 𝚋, 𝚌, 𝚍, 𝚎
. There are two types of letters:
vowels — the letters 𝚊 and 𝚎. They are represented by 𝖵.
consonants — the letters 𝚋, 𝚌, and 𝚍. They are represented by 𝖢
There are two types of syllables in the language: 𝖢𝖵 (consonant followed by vowel) or 𝖢𝖵𝖢 (vowel with consonant before and after). 
For example, 𝚋𝚊, 𝚌𝚎𝚍, 𝚋𝚊𝚋 are syllables, but 𝚊𝚊, 𝚎𝚍𝚊, 𝚋𝚊𝚋𝚊 are not.
A word in the language is a sequence of syllables. Lura has written a word in the language, but she doesn't know how to split it into syllables. 
Help her break the word into syllables.
For example, given the word 𝚋𝚊𝚌𝚎𝚍𝚋𝚊𝚋, it would be split into syllables as 𝚋𝚊.𝚌𝚎𝚍.𝚋𝚊𝚋 (the dot . represents a syllable boundary).
//ALGORITHM:
1.We will iterate from end to begin
2.If we find vowel push_back s[i],s[i-1],'.' in ans string
3.Else push_back s[i],s[i-1],s[i-2],'.' in ans string
4.pop_back() last dot
5.reversing the ans string we get the actual one

//CODE:
int l;
string s,ans;
cin>>l;
cin>>s;
for(int i=l-1;i>=0;i--){
 if(s[i]=='a'||s[i]=='e'){
  ans.push_back(s[i]);
  ans.push_back(s[i-1]);
  ans.push_back('.');
  i--;
 }
 else{
  ans.push_back(s[i]);
  ans.push_back(s[i-1]);
  ans.push_back(s[i-2]);
  ans.push_back('.');
  i-=2;
 }
 
}
ans.pop_back();
reverse(ans.begin(),ans.end());
 cout<<ans<<endl;
