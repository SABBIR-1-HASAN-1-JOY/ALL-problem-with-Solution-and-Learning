//problem:
A certain number 1≤𝑥≤10^9 is chosen. 
You are given two integers 𝑎 and 𝑏 , which are the two largest divisors of the number 𝑥
. At the same time, the condition 1≤𝑎<𝑏<𝑥 is satisfied.
For the given numbers 𝑎, 𝑏, you need to find the value of 𝑥

Algorithm:
1.If b%a != 0 then ans= lcm(a,b)
2. Else b=a.p here p must be the smallest prime factor of b and x
 so ans = b* b/a

//CODE:
int a,b,gc,lcd;
    cin>>a>>b;
    if(a==1) cout<<b*b<<endl;
    else{
      gc=__gcd(a,b);
      lcd=(a/gc)*b;
      if(lcd==b) cout<<(b/a)*b<<endl;
      else cout<<lcd<<endl;
    }
